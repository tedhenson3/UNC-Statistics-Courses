Your report should clearly indicate your conclusions accompanied by appropriate tables and graphs. You are welcome to use R Markdown but please edit it to highlight your conclusions and to remove computer output not relevant to your analysis. It is preferable to submit the report as a single pdf file but alternative formats including html are acceptable so long as we can read them.
